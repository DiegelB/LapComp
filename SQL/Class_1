Database - logical structure to store data.

Database managment system (DBMS) - software to create and interact with the
database.

Character - basic unit of data, and it can be a letter, number, or symbol.
Field - group of related characters
Record - a collection of fields
File - group of records 

Character is the basic unit of a database.

A feild represents an arrtribute or characteristics of an enitity
Corrosponds to a column in the physical database

A record is a collection of fields, corrosponds to a row in the pysical
database.

A file is a group of records abut the same type of entity.
The logical database is considered an entity. (entity relationship diagram)
The physical database is considered a table. (the actual database or DBMS)

Data storage: manage the physical structure of the database 
Securtiy: control user access and privileges
Multiuser access: manage cocurrent data access
Backup: enable recovery options for database failures (disater recovery)
Data access language: provide a language that allows database access
Data integrity: enable constraints or checks on data
Data dictionary: maintain information about database structure

System development life cycle:
- system investiogation - understanding the problem 
- system anaysis - understanding the solution
- system design - creating the lofical and physical components
- system implementation - placing completed system into operation
- system mainteance and review - evaluating the implemented system

Entity-relationship model:
- used to depict relathionships that exist among entites
- the following relathionships can be included in an E-R model
	- one-to-one
	1 person has only 1 birth mom
	- one-to-many
	1 mom can have many children
	- many-to-many
	many children can have many hobbies 
- one-to-one:
	- each occurrence of data in one entity is represented by only one
	occurrence of data in the other entity
- one-to-many:
	- each occurrence of data in one entity can be represented by many 
	occurenced of the data in the other entity
- many-to-many:
	- data can have multiple occurrences in both entites

Database normalization:
determines the amount of colomns and rows in a database.
used to reduce or control data redundancy.
- data reduncany - refers to having the same data in different places of the
database
- data anamolies - refers to data inconcistinces

First normal form (1NF):
primary key is identifed (bus #, lunch #, student ID)
repeating groups are eliminated 

Composite primary key:
more than one column is required to uniquley identify a row
can lead to partial dependency - a column is only dependent on a portion of
the primary key
